"""UrKanren

The following is intended to help both myself and others understand micro-kanren constraints.

While the overall goal of this project is to make a fully Pythonic Kanren, for the
purposes of this file the emphasis is clarity, particularly for those who are using
it to supliment reading papers on the subject.

The papers I've found to be the most illuminating and which have directly impacted
the design here are:

ÂµKanren: A Minimal Functional Core for Relational Programming

    "What?" I hear you ask, "This is Python we have plenty of very nice
    data structures, why on Earth would we want Lisp style lists?"

    And that's true, for getting real work done, I'll take Python lists over
    linked lists any day.

    But. One of the interesting things you can do in micro-kanren is represent
    cases where you know things about the front of a list and have no idea how
    long the list is.  For example, I could say that I know for the list `l` that
    `l[0] == 'cake'`, and that is all I know about the list. It may have 100 values,
    or `'cake'` may be all there is. This is very hard to represent using Python lists,
    but in this style of linked list can be represented like this: `Link('cake', LogicVariable(0))`
